# Tour Stuff

## Project Overview

Welcome to Tour Stuff, the Tour Manager To-Do List App! This application is designed specifically for musicians and tour managers who need a streamlined and efficient way to manage their tasks whilst on tour. Inspired by a conversation with a friend who found existing to-do apps either too feature-rich or lacking the necessary functionality, this app aims to provide a perfect balance of simplicity and utility.

## Features

- **User Accounts**: Create and manage your own account.
- **Tours**: Create top-level lists called Tours.
- **Sublists and Items**: Organize your Tours with sublists, which in turn contain individual items.
- **Daily Reset**: Set lists to reset at a specific time each day, perfect for recurring tasks like distributing daily stipends.
- **Firebase Backend**: All data is securely stored and managed with Firebase.

## Future Upgrades

We have several exciting upgrades planned for future versions of the app:
- **Different Colour Schemes**: Customize each Tour with a unique colour scheme.
- **Enhanced Sublists Settings**: More options and settings for sublists to improve organization.
- **Editing Capabilities**: Ability to edit Tours and lists for better flexibility.
- **Account Page**: A dedicated page to manage your account.
- **Edit Account Information**: Options to update your personal account details.
